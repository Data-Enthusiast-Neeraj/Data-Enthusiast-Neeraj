## Hi, I'm Neeraj Sahu!

**Data Analyst**

## About Me
I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate with a strong interest in data-driven problem solving and analytics.

To transition into the data domain, I completed an Advanced Certification in Full Stack Data Science & AI (August 2024 – December 2025) provided by the Electronics & ICT Academy, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati, gaining hands-on experience through industry-style projects and real-world datasets.

During my learning journey, I worked extensively on Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), KPI Reporting, and Dashboard Development using Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel.

I have a solid foundation in Statistics, including Descriptive Statistics, Probability, and Hypothesis Testing, along with a working understanding of Machine Learning fundamentals such as data preprocessing and clustering techniques.

I enjoy transforming raw data into meaningful insights and visual stories that support business decision-making. I am actively seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst / Business Intelligence Analyst where I can apply my analytical skills and continue growing in the data field.
